# Reproduce the results of PIE paper
This repository contains the source code related to the PIE paper published in ACM WNS3 2016 [1].

There are two main directories in this repository: ns-2 and ns-3

ns-2 and ns-3 directories contain the ns-2 and ns-3 source code related to PIE simulation results demonstrated in the paper, respectively. Each directory contains a separate README file which details the steps to reproduce the results.
